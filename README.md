### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Frontend developer with a background in design and textile art. I am looking to explore the intersection of creative practice and technical development, building responsive and maintainable interfaces with JavaScript, TypeScript, React and other technologies. I also work full stack with Node.js, databases and backend integrations.
